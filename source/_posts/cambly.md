- My favourite food is chicken. The restaurant in my community always boils the chicken and drizzles the sauce on it. It names Sliced Boiled Chicken.
- I like to steam crab. It is very simple. I just need to clean the crab and put in on pot to steam. The Crab and crab yellow are very delicious. October and November are the best period to eat crab.
- I think it should be dumpling. We eat dumplings in almost every festival. Dumplings are something that has filling sticked by leather. The filling could be meat fixed vegetables, shrimp and everything you want.
